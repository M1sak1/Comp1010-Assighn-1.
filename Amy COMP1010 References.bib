Abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) as a learning media has a very great potential to help students learn history, including Indonesian ancient history. AR gave the opportunity for students to learn heritages from Indonesian's ancient history, i.e. from Singhasari period, by scanning a marker that would show 3D model in their smartphone screen. This research focusing on the effectivity of AR as media for history learning by comparing students' score in a pre-test - post-test design. 30 students from 10th grade at a vocational high school involved in this quasi experiment. Overall, the AR is effective as history learning media in improving students' score. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
